# test_task_CLI
It was necessary to make a simple service that interactively calls some subprogram. That is, a certain top-level menu, in which the user selects one of the available subprograms, and begins to work with it.  

Functional parts of the service:
- Calculator
- Git-client
- Interaction with external API / REST service
